## Currency Conversion

This little programm converts your currency to every other currency you want to. Furthermore, it shows you if the conversion is good or bad for you by colorizing the background either green or red.

You have to implement your own URL endpoint to use the conversion, since it works with an online get request to get all the information.
Webpage I use is stored as constant in the Settings file. You just need to add your personal API key into the Settings file -> API_KEY constant to get started.
